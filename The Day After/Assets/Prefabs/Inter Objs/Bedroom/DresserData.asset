  ExhaustedDialogue:
  - "Tempting to smoke more, but you\u2019ve had enough for now."
  QuestEventDialogue:
  - Old pills, a half smoked joint, a random shirt with a hole clearly burned in
    it, nyquil, and a pack of joints.
  - "You don\u2019t recall smoking that joint, but it smells pretty fresh."
  - "You think hard for a moment and remember that\u2019s how you fell asleep last
    night."
  - Maybe you should stop smoking so much...
  - You toss the pills, nyquil, and shirt into the drawer.
  - You pick up the pack of joints and feel the temptation.
  - 'To your better judgement, you decide to finish the joint. '
  - You pull a ligher out from your pocket and light up.  Smoking used to be a big
    issue for you.
  - "Well, it still is, if you're honest, but you\u2019ve gotten better."
  - Smoking always puts you at ease. For the most part.
  - 'You quietly enjoy the rest of the joint before putting the pack into the drawer
    too. '
