  - Out of everything in your room, somehow your closest is the cleanest.
  - "Probably because you\u2019ve thrown your clothes everywhere else but here."
  - "Aside from sorting some shoes and other bits and bobs, there wasn\u2019t much
    to clean."
  - As you close the doors, you notice an old work shirt grumbled in the corner.
  - "It\u2019s from your latest job. You can\u2019t quite recall the name, but it
    rhymes with carpet."
  - You pull it out and take a look. It still has your name badge on it.
  - "There were some fun coworkers there, and the job wasn\u2019t half bad, but...
    man the mistakes..."
  - You wonder how Alex and Drew are doing after you three were arrested. Last you
    heard they were still working at the same store.
  - "You almost toss the shirt back into the closest, but realize there\u2019s no
    reason for you to keep it."
  - "You grumble it up and shoot it at your trash can from across the room. It\u2019s
    a swish."
