  AddedToInventoryDialogue:
  - Realizing how horrid your desk space has become, you start picking up the bits
    of trash and leftover food.
  - "Amidst the molding pieces of food, you find an old book. It\u2019s your yearbook
    from senior year."
  - Nostalgia takes hold and you decide to flip through the pages.
  - A few pages have your name underneath the copies, and some pictures too.
  - You spent four years on the yearbook staff, afterall.
  - Well, maybe not four, since you never showed up to school, but four nonetheless.
  - You wonder what school would have been like if you never joined that class. It
    was the source of many late nights and exuberant amounts of stress, but you enjoyed
    the company of your peers.
  - You reach the senior portraits section. There you are, the dashing eighteen year
    old.
  - You wonder how things would have turned out had you tried harder in high school.
  - "Now you\u2019re twenty-one and still not even attending the local community
    college."
  - You close the book and put it with the other bits of trash you plan on throwing
    away.
