  DisplayDialogue:
  - You throw off your pajamas and hop into the shower.
  - You forgot how nice the warm water feels on your skin.
  - Your enjoyment is interrupted by the thought of what happened two weeks ago.
  - "You feel guilty. You don\u2019t feel like you should be thinking about it."
  - "You start to feel panicked, or maybe you\u2019re just high."
  - Your breathing picks up, and the confined space of the shower starts to feel
    like it's choking you.
  - You shut off the water and quickly jump out of the shower.
  - "Your therapist\u2019s voice reminds you to breathe, and you do just that."
  - You look around the bathroom and start pointing out colors that are on the rainbow
    to yourself.
  - "It\u2019s a dumb trick, and meant for kids, but it works for you."
  - You keep breathing, but the cold air starts to nip at your bare skin.
  - You change into the clothes you bought. It feels nice to get dressed.
  - "You still feel a bit uneasy, and locking yourself back in your room doesn\u2019t
    sound very smart."
  - "You feel a bit hungry as well, and Mom\u2019s been making you food non stop."
  - Maybe you should make a meal yourself.
